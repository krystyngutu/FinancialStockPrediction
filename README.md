**Stock Prediction**

Build a trading (security) strategy for future stock purchases based on historical values. 

Perform two (2) distinct simple trading strategies in Python which will be based on Machine Learning Classification modeling approaches. 

The strategies will be such that will call for a ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ signal of a certain security. The signal will equate to the target/label variable used by the ML classifiers. Namely, the target variable would be either a buying or selling the stock based on feature variables. The target variable content should be constructed as follows: Store the value of +1 for the buy signal and -1 for the sell signal, respectively.

Strategy-1: If the next trading day's close price is greater than today's close price then, the signal is ‘buy’, otherwise ‘sell’.

Strategy-2: Utilize the 50-day moving average vs the 200-day moving average.
